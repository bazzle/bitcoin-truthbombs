Inflation, in terms of a free market phenomenon is a good thing. If the supply of something drops and demand stays the same, prices for that thing rise. This is a naturally occuring defence mechanism to address the balance between supply and demand. If a disease destroyed half the worlds’ banana crop, bananas must increase in price, or else the remaining supply would be wiped out. If advances in fishing techniques came close to eradicating fish populations, price of fish would increase, lowering demand and allowing the populations to recover.

Monetary inflation is something different entirely.

Deflation can be a result of “printing more” products, through improvements in manufacturing technology. Increasing the supply, demand stays the same, price goes down.

Inflation is the result of “printing more” money, increasing the supply, more money chasing the same amount of goods.
