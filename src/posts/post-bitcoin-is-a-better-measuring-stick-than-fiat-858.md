# Bitcoin is a better measuring stick than fiat

**Money needs to be elastic? Needs to expand ??**

From Robert Breedlove

Bullshit, as a unit of measurement needs reliable fixity. Thinking fiat monetary expansion is good, is like changing the definition of what a metre is, and thinking by using that new metre, you’ll end up with a bigger house.

We need to all understand a metre is a metre so we can collaborate on the building of a house.

Same is true for economy. Introduces noise to the channel. Ends up in capital misallocation. Creates distortion and confusion.

Example, if you’re using a ruler to measure a table, but you can’t trust the constancy of the ruler. You don’t know if you’re measuring the table or the ruler lol you need a constant frame of reference to perceive the world. That’s FIAT. we don’t know how many dollars in circulation, don’t know who’s profiting from it’s production.

Gold was selected as perfect money. We can’t trust the medium, value investments don’t work anymore.

## Greg Foss

You need to understand a house isn’t going up in value, the unit of account/fiat money it is being marked up in is going down in value. So, if the price of a house is up 10% in a year, but inflation is 10%, then the house value hasn’t increased but maintained the same value.
