# Altcoins require you to trust

**Despite what they claim, most altcoins requires you to trust**. You need to trust the publicly known founder(s) to not become censored or coerced by controlling entities such as governments. You need to trust them to be moral and not enrich themselves through co-ordinated pumping and dumping. You need to trust them not to change the protocol your money is parked in. Ethereum for example is in a constant state of flux. The founder and his close band of premine beneficiaries disingenuously claim its token can be a store of value, when its inflation rate changes along with the fundamental rules of the protocol. Many shitcoins, despite marketing themselves as being decentralised, follow the same model as fiat currencies – centralised money issuance and manipulation. Decentralised in name only.
