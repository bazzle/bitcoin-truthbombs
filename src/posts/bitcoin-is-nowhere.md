# Bitcoin is nowhere

Bitcoin is not a bearer asset. When you “receive” bitcoin, you don’t actually receive any bitcoin. Bitcoin has no physical nor digital form.

Your bitcoin wallet doesn’t hold any bitcoin tokens, in fact a bitcoin wallet is better analogised as a signing device. Like a prefilled check, waiting for your**signature**.

Bitcoin represents 100 million satoshi’s, and satoshi’s are units of bitcoin. Again satoshi’s are nothing more than units on the Blockchain. The blockchain is proof of how much of the bitcoin fixed supply you’ve acquired. In the form of unspent transaction outputs.

The only entity you own in the traditional sense of ownership is your private key on your signing device which allows you access to bitcoin as recorded on the blockchain.

Go into Knut’s book, everything divided by 21 million. chapter 2.. And watch this vid;
