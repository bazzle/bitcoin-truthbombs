**If you take a loan for 100 thousand dollars at a bank**, that money is created through nothing more than moving around some money by tapping some digits onto a computer. A bank clerk can magic into existence a million dollars with the same amount of physical expenditure as it would take a hundred.

**The newly printed money only receives real-world value when it is in the hands of the debtor**, when they have to work and provide real-world value to pay it back, with interest. The economy, driven by the fiat monetary system relies on people to shackle themselves in debt to sustain itself. Fiat money at its point of creation has no intrinsic value other that the simple fact that the government decrees it so. The fiat issuers and those close to them become excessively wealthy. The debtors get helplessly impoverished and wealth gap turns into a chasm.

Bitcoin, with its proof of work consensus mechanism, ensuring that every satoshi has been created through a certain amount of physical work is a representation of energy. Fiat is debt, backed by government decree. Bitcoin is a receipt of energy, backed by proof of work. And the difficulty adjustment ensures the issuance of new sats remains constant regardless of hashrate on the network. The digital representation of time and energy. The truest possible form of value.
