# Fiat maximalism 2

Fiat maximalism describes people who think bitcoin and crypto as nothing more than investments, and that money can be nothing else but fiat.

When it comes to money, the mental model the masses of us have adopted — consciously or not, is that of fiat. This word is latin for *Let it be done*. In other words, authorised and enforced by the state. Not backed by any precious commodity which money typically is backed by.

The tragedy of fiat is that we are conditioned to accept (or are oblivious to) the fact that our central banks – duty bound by the state can, and do manipulate the money we trade our scarce time for. We literally indebt ourselves to a system which is controlled by a small group of unelected people in suits. Making decisions behind closed doors that affect our lives more directly and profoundly than elected politicians are able to.

Despite being at the sore end of this deal, many of us remain staunchly loyal to the fiat monetary system and fail to see the possibility of Bitcoin replacing fiat in the future. This kind of tunnel vision is largely due to the fact that we were all born during the time of either partial or complete state capture of the gold standard. And so as fiat and its repercussions monopolised the financial system and embedded itself in society, it has in turn monopolised us, our behaviour and our thoughts about what money is at its core.

The depths of our conditioning varies between ourselves, likely defined by environmental factors which are numerous and potentially complex, although we can assume proximity to the money issuer and how well an individual is able to live within the fiat financial world is the main defining factor.

We can be more certain about an individuals fiat conditioning based on how they view bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. They either maintain a dogmatic loyalty to fiat and show themselves as truest form of fiat maximalist, in that they avoid alternatives altogether. Or they embrace bitcoin and crypto, perhaps even disingeniously talking up the virtues of Bitcoin, but then showing themselves as only being interested in maximalising fiat gains. In this category are the worst kind of fiat maximalists. The shitcoin founders and their backers, the scammers and the social media grifters. They see the asset class through the exploitative lens, attracted by the deep pool of liquidity in the space. They have only one thing on their minds, filling their bags with as much fiat as possible.

Fiat maximalists might have a 1% allocation to bitcoin in their investment portfolios, and when, as inevitably happens — their Bitcoin outsizes what else they hold, they would sell out just to rebalance. They are obsessed with fiat denominated price, and attempt to time the lows to buy more, and the highs to sell out. The irony is, the Bitcoin maximalists — in allocating large portions, if not all of their portfolios in bitcoin, and stubbornly HODL’ing end up with much more fiat denominated gain than the fiat maximalists do.

Fiat maximalists tend to speak of Bitcoin as nothing more than an instrument of the very system of which it is set to disrupt. An asset that is stacked up against stocks that have similar market caps, compared against things which it is not slightly comparable to.

Bitcoin specifically, people either become true low time-preference plebs and continue stacking satoshi’s for the good their progeny and humanity, or they stack sats or crypto tokens with the sole aim of seeing a fiat return. These people are **fiat maximalists**.

Most people though, simply hold moderate views. It would be unreasonable to label everyone outside the Bitcoin or hard-money camps as fiat maximalists. Playing by the rules imposed by the state doesn’t imply favour of them. They might understand that the fiat system is broken but reasonably argue that it is too deeply embedded to uproot. But it is worth reminding ourselves that the fiat monetary system is nothing more than an experiment that only fully actualised itself in 1971 when then president Nixon ended gold convertability. For 5000 year before, humanity had been living on a hard-money gold standard to some extent. And will likely resume a hard money standard with Bitcoin at its core, well into the future. It is without doubt that the most optimised form money is based on scarcity and immutability, and humanity will always gravitate towards that.

So for the newbie to bitcoin, what comes next in their journey is key, and this fork in the road explicitly spells out the difference in ideology between bitcoin and fiat maximalism. To take fiat profits, to satiate short-term wants and adhere to the financial status-quo that is keeping them from true wealth. Or the path of the bitcoin maximalist, which leads to a much more meaningful set of ideals for themselves, their families and the societies they are part of – self-sovereignty, responsibility and support for the global paradigm shift, away from rotten fiat, towards the new hard money standard of Bitcoin.
