In part 1, I spoke about the effects of HODL’ing bitcoin to achieve wealth for the self and future generations, promote low time preference thinking and presented a counter argument that HODL’ing might not always be the right approach for the best outcomes. Now I zoom out and think about the effects of HODL’ing through the lens of bitcoin adoption and the principles and goals bitcoin as a money and protocol align with.

Bitcoin aims to introduce a new monetary paradigm, disrupt the monopoly of the centralised traditional finance system and to satisfy the fundamental principles of what money should be. It is abundantly fair to question how useful it is for us all to do nothing more with our stacks than sit on them like Scrooge McDuck who likes to swims in his vault of gold coins.

If we want the network effects of bitcoin to truly proliferate, we need to promote the use in circular economies, and of course that means selling. Bitcoin needs to find its way into the hands of people who wouldn’t typically own it. Businesses that accept Bitcoin should be whole heartedly supported by bitcoiners, as if they don’t turn up with their wallets the businesses will, with little doubt stop offering bitcoin as payment due to lack of demand.

This effect was observed by bitcoin explorers in El Salvador. The heart of top-down bitcoin adoption. With their president Nayyib Bukele giving bitcoin legal currency status in the country there was an initial hype phase, and with some government assistance, vendors were kitted out with wallets. But upon revisiting a year later, most had ditched their wallets due to lack of demand. Could local plebs and bitcoin tourists have kept the retailers from resigning their wallet devices to the dark, dusty depths of their cupboards, who knows.

Should bitcoiners and scarce asset absolutists be the ones to judge what is scarce for the individual? experiences with close family and friends can absolutely be regarded as scarce. An expensive car is unlikely to be scarce, but the experiences to be had in it might be. Further to that, life itself is absolutely scarce. Is it not a worthwhile trade to sell one absolutely scarce asset for another? To help provide enjoyment during the limited time we all have on the planet.
