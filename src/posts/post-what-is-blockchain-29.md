# Blockchain

Blockchain is a distributed ledger which records specific information such as transactions made with a cryptocurrency. Blockchain refers to a chain of blocks, each block stores a number of transactions. In Bitcoin’s case, however many transactions which are made in a ten minute period. As opposed to a centralised database blockchains such as the Bitcoin blockchain are decentralised, meaning it exists on thousands of computers worldwide. The advantage of this is it’s not vulnerable to being closed down, or the data held on it modified by a single entity, through their own will or coercion.
