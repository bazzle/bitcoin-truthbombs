# Bitcoin maximalism

Let’s talk about the former first. Nearly every new bitcoiner is a fiat maximalist and that’s ok. The sad fact is, the fiat monopoly in just about every nation on the planet has resulted in fiat maximalism being the default state for the billions of working people around the world. To this end we are all fiat maximalists as we trade our time and energy for for fiat simply because there is no other choice. The only exception are the most hardcore bitcoin plebs who earn and spend on a bitcoin standard. Doing this is still a pipe dream for most people.

For this reason, fiat tendencies such as obsession with fiat-denominated price, and talk about taking short term profits, should not be judged too harshly by bitcoin maxi’s. In fact, today’s bitcoin plebs likely were attracted because of the dramatic increase in bitcoin’s fiat denominated price since its inception. Bitcoin’s so called “marketing strategy” is its “Number go Up” technology – the programmed issuance and scarcity of bitcoin that ensures its value increases over time in fiat terms.

The gradual mindset shift from fiat to bitcoin maximalist often happens when one starts using actually using bitcoin as a medium of exchange, and thinking of it in practical terms. The first purchase made using the Lightning network is a monumental “a ha” moment. The immediate settlement between parties in different locations and political jurisdictions exposes the shortcomings of the current financial rails, and the scandalously profiteering remittance layers in between simple monetary transfers.

But when one goes down the bitcoin rabbit hole. A series of realisations tend to surface. The programmed properties of bitcoin that make it an undeniably robust store of value, like the Proof of Work consensus mechanism, the supply cap of 21 million and the difficulty adjustment that ensures stable issuance and inflation rate. The compelling bitcoin mining incentives that stabilise power grids and the transition to renewable power. The nature of the distributed ledger, being totally immutable, decentralised and through its network of nodes validating each transaction, being the most audited monetary system that has ever existed.

It’s beyond the scope of this article to go too deep into bitcoin first principles. But the biggest kicker that turns many people into true bitcoin maximalists, is the realisation of how broken the fiat monetary system is. How fiat, in being totally unbacked by any scarce resource is infinitely printable which lays the groundwork for inflation, which sends the monetary system into a negative feedback loop where it must print more to service ever-increasing debts, and in turn deceptively robs honest people of their hard-earned savings.

Many bitcoin maxis advocate for hyperbitcoin – talk about 1 bitcoin = 1 bitcoin

**Fiat maximalism can be defined by two quite distinct mindsets**. The unwitting inclination to value bitcoin in fiat which most people who have just come across bitcoin tend to display, a result of what I like to call fiat conditioning. And the single-minded steadfast belief that fiat – unbacked government issued currency, is the only true form of money. This is fiat maximalism in the truest sense of the word.
