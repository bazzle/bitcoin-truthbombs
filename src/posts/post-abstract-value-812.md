The well known tale of the Hare and the Tortoise tells us about opposing mindsets. The tortoise who is consistent, steadfast and humble and the hare who is narcisistic, showy and arrogant.

The dichotomy between these two is very pertinent when you think of the difference between bitcoin and shitcoins, in terms of what they are at their core, the perceived importance of speed and performance and the philosophical and political virtues they are designed or marketed to gratify, and, of course the mindsets of the people they tend to attract.

Many people within crypto will agree that bitcoin is slow and in some ways boring. It is true that the design of bitcoin demonstrates a utilitarian approach for good reason. If you hadn’t already guessed, bitcoin is the tortoise.

In the same way the hare boasts to the other animals, about how fast he is, and nobody can beat him in a race, shitcoins, use their VC funded marketing budgets to boast about having the fastest, most performant blockchains. Their websites bear the typical slogans – unmatched transaction speeds and throughput. Transactions on this shiny new blockchain can happen hundreds, no thousands of times faster than visa. And the carbon emissions are less than an ants fart!

Things like transaction speeds and environmental footprint sound like good tangible characteristics, but really these are only made possible because they are benchmarked within their own self-determined abstract models of value.

To explain this, it’s useful to think of what backs the issuance of tokens. With bitcoin, proof of work presents a direct tie to forms of real world scarcity, through the usage of electricity to mine new coins. This, along with the block reward and difficulty adjustment – is what gives bitcoin its scarcity. And its security, in that colossal amounts of energy would be required to hijack the network.

Shitcoins, specifically those backed by proof of stake do not have any such tie to the real-world, implying they are tied to nothing but their own abstract value models of value, and as a result are probably not particularly well suited as a money in the real world. This is something made abundantly clear when Vitalik Buterin, the creator of Ethereum expressed how ethereum can underwrite a new paradigm of virtual abstract reality. A pretty obvious admission that ethereum is more suited for the world of make-believe than the real world.

However, in not being tethered by boundaries imposed by the real world, they are able to boast about how fast and performant their blockchains are, and as a result are able to appeal to the types of people who are receptive – usually high time preference crypto moonboys who don’t look beyond performance metrics and multipliers when judging what cryptocurrency they want to invest in.

Bitcoin is the tortoise in the tale, slow and steady –**tick tock, next block**. Bitcoin is undoubtedly slower in adding transactions to its blockchain, than hyped up shitcoins like ethereum and solana. Its seemingly languid nature is often the reason why naysayers conclude it is useless as a medium of exchange. What they don’t realise (aside from the Lightning Network) is the simple fact that bitcoin*needs*to be slow if it wants to be the digital bedrock of value.

Learning about the need for the bitcoin network to be slow, steady, boring, and just about everything that the latest hyped up shitcoin blockchain isn’t, would lead you down a fresh rabbit hole – the first principles of money, that introduces what makes a money effective and sound. To dramatically simplify, for people to have confidence in money, it needs to not change that much over time.

And that brings me to the next thing. Bitcoin is a protocol!

Then segway into, understanding the above requires education, understanding of the nuances. A lot of patience, and low time preference.

what makes an effective money is a rabbit hole in itself, and so is the thinking behind computer protocols.

Crypto, with its catchy names, funky logos and irresistible tech talking points like transaction speeds, web3, smart contracts, dapps and dao’s, aswell as the attraction of staking yields and single day double-digit price movements create the environment where the high time preference crypto moonboy – – likes to inhabit.

They might be able to capitalise at the right time in the bull market depending on the particular shitcoin they are holding, but will more than likely eventually get rekt, like the average punter at a casino. They might win big on the roulette table, but they are unlikely to leave the building with anything but empty bags. Needless to say by the end of the bull market, when the party is over, they will be holding less than the bitcoin hodler – the tortoise in the tale.

**The bitcoiner hodler dollar cost averages through the market cycles.**And despite seeing the value of their stack swing wildly through the price volatility, do not sell large portions. Remaining unemotional, firm, steadfast and humble.

**For the crypto moonboy, the bull market is the race to riches.**For the bitcoin hodler, the bull market is a time of irrational hype. An unwelcome distraction. A time when bitcoin is no longer selling at a discount. That’s right, bitcoin hodlers celebrate the price dropping, so they can stack sats at a much lower price.

**Naturally, the bitcoin hodler, in being uninterested in winning the race to riches has won that race already.** The proven winning strategy of dollar cost averaging in an asset that appreciates over time will always beat short term speculation. The hodler, in adopting the healthier mindset of saving money in a verifiably scarce asset, rather than speculating in the latest crypto trend will reap dividends beyond monetary.

**But, to actually be the humble tortoise, to be the bitcoin hodler is a challenge in itself**. Just staying humble is a challenge in modern society, which rewards narcisism and pushes us towards everything that is meaningless, fleeting and superficial. A challenge in dedicating hours of education in bitcoin to have the conviction requred to overcome the natural tendency to sell out through fear and uncertainty. A challenge in pulling away from fiat conditioning, through conviction towards a new monetary paradigm that is bitcoin. Stay Humble, Stack Sats is more than a strategy for acquiring bitcoin, it’s step in the direction towards a healthy low time preference mindset and a vote for more equal, productive and peaceful future for society.

Bitcoin is slow, steady and largely unchanging–characteristics that are necessary for bitcoin to be a monetary protocol, a base software and settlement layer that other things are built upon, and a trusted store of monetary value, important because nobody would want to put their life savings in a technology that is changing all the time at its core.
