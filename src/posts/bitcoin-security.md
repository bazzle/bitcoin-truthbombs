# Bitcoin security

Joe “Pomp” Pompliano had an excellent way of explaining Bitcoin security in his podcast. When asked about whether crypto noobs/fudders know the difference between an exchange being hacked and bitcoin being hacked.

By drawing parallells with the legacy banking system. The most secure parts of the system have never been hacked, same goes with Bitcoin and I paraphrase;

> “A Crypto exchange can be hacked, like someone can walk into a bank with a gun, and rob the bank, right, so the infrastructure itself can be hacked, that doesn’t mean the asset, the bitcoin blockchain is hacked, or any of the other protoclols themselves. I have a framework I use which is, the Federal Reserve, and the US Treasury, those are like the spigot, in terms of where the dollars come from in the generalised manner, and so the closer you are to the spigot, the more secure it is. No one is walking into the US Treasury, or the Federal Reserve and robbing it. But, the further you get away from the spigot, the less secure something becomes. So if all of a sudden the money gets put into an armored truck, somebody could rob it, you put 5 dollars into your pocket and walk down the street, someone could hit you over the head with a wrench, right, someone can take your five bucks. So the further away from the spigot, the less secure it gets. The closer to the spigot the more secure”

> Same exact thing with Bitcoin, On the bitcoin blockchain, most secure computing network in the world, never been hacked before, by far has the most computing power pointing to it, running it validating it etc, and so you have the most security on the actual network itself, the further you get away from it, the more likely it is you’re getting less secure.”
