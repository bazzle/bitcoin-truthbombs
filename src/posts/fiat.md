# Fiat

Introduce what fiat it is, how it’s broken. Negative incentives it breeds.

**Easy money also propagates a debt based economy**. A bank can create a loan and deposit that money in your account in seconds. The real-world representation of that money only materialises when you create value through the work you must do to pay off that debt.

Governments and corporations will always choose to indebt themselves rather than use money they have on their balance sheets because it’s so much cheaper. Money can be borrowed at todays value and be repaid in the future when that money is worth less due to inflation. Another nuance about easy money that is abundantly attractive for the elites but disastrous for everybody else.

**Money printing causes debasement,**which is what makes tangible goods so much more expensive. More units of currency in circulation chasing the same amount of goods. The inflation caused by monetary debasement by the hand of government is often described as a hidden tax on citizens.

Easy fiat money incentivises top-down government allocation of capital rather than the healthy dynamics of free markets. Easy money disincentivises productivity and innovation and incentivises crony capitalism where those with strong ties to state and easier access to the money printer skew the healthy dynamics of free capitalist markets, creating zombie companies and hindering the process of creative destruction.

Despite the collapse of the gold standard, a time when currencies were fully convertible, gold has continued to be the yardstick of value, as it has for thousands of years. Gold cannot be manipulated like fiat currency can be. Introducing the aforementioned 18% of the supply would require a ramp-up of mining efforts that would be unrealistic without some kind of technology that only Douglas Adams could imagine — a machine at the hands of the Vogons that could split the earth open like cracking an egg and suck out all the nuggets of gold whilst humanity is incapacitated by their dreadful poetry.

Bitcoin has a capped supply of 21 million coins. No more coins will ever be minted. And the decentralised network of nodes are incentivised to ensure this cap isn’t ever increased. The difficulty adjustment mechanism ensures predictable issuance, and that the supply can’t be flooded with new coins at any time. Bitcoin is digital gold, a digital hard money for the 21st century.

We can see that in the reality we’re living right now, which is our current financial system of government issued money. A monetary system of easy money which replaced the Gold standard – a system of hard money whereby paper currency was fully backed by gold. Since 1971 when Richard Nixon declared that dollars were no longer redeemable, we’ve had massive government spending.

A lot of people will argue that this has had an overwhelming benefit, in lifting countries out of poverty, allowing for unlimited financing for developments in technology, infrastructure, jobs and wealth. However, one assertion made in The Bitcoin Standard is that if it wasn’t for the suspension of the Gold Standard during WW1 each of the beligerants would have run out of financing to continue the war and millions of lives wouldn’t have been unnecesarily lost, effectively forcing outcomes through diplomacy rather than violence.

Easy money incentivises top-down government allocation of capital rather than the healthy dynamics of free markets. Easy money disincentivises productivity and innovation and incentivises political games where those with strong ties to government and easier access to the money printer have a head start. This has a disastrous effect on democracy where political lobbying is a game of who has the most money is able to force through policy.

Easy money also promotes a debt based economy. When you think for a second how easy it is for banks to create a loan for you. By tapping a few keys on a keyboard, a lender can magic into existence a million dollars with the same physical exertion as it would a hundred. The real-world representation of that money only materialises when you create value through the work you must do to pay off that debt. Governments and corporations will always choose to indebt themselves rather than use money they have on their balance sheets because it’s so much cheaper.

 To the regular joe or jane, easy money will put you at the whim of your governments. Their printing means more money in circulation, and that means the small portion of money that is in your bank account will be worth less in terms of purchasing power over time. And looking at things in a wider economical level,

## The economics of Bitcoin’s scarcity

The fixed supply of 21 million coins together with the divisibility of the units are two features that allow Bitcoin to maintain scarcity. Supply and demand dynamics will ensure the value will increase as long as there’s demand. And demand for stores of value will keep increasing as long as governments keep devaluing their currencies.

### Supply shock

A supply shock is an often sudden demand for something and lack of supply to meet that demand resulting in a considerable increase in price. You just need to take a look at the coin distribution to get an idea of how this relates to bitcoin. Out of the 21 million max supply cap, 18.8 million are held, of those 4.2 million are lost, never to be found. Leaving only 2.2 million bitcoin to be mined.
