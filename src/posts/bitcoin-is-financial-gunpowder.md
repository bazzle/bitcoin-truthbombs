**Ever since humans started developing cognitive abilities, they have invented and used tools to survive**. Through years of trial and error, the best tools have sustained and the methods to build them have spread amongst tribes. One such tool was fire. Those who figured out how to make use of fire survived in the battle against nature. They stayed warm at night, had light to find the way and deterred predators. Those who relied upon their time honoured method of waving around a club ultimately became extinct.

The value of tools becomes glaringly evident in war. The survival chances of a soldier who’s rifle has broken immediately plummets, as he would be up against assailants that*have*working rifles. If the French army decided to “keep it real” with sticks and stones and swords, and not use gunpowder, an army*with*gunpowder will come along and take over France with relative ease.

Money is a type of tool just like fire and weapons. Some work very well and some not so well.*Natural Law*dictates that people will seek out the best tool they have access to if the basic needs of themselves and their family is at stake. A Nigerian will prefer to be paid in dollars rather than Naira, because the value won’t inflate away overnight, and he will be able to feed himself and his family with more nutritious food for a far longer period of time.

Just like gunpowder, Bitcoin will proliferate until a tipping point is reached, where those that chose to not hold this better tool would become noticeably disadvantaged, and will find themselves needing to get some like it or not. Whether they are individuals, small businesses, corporations or nation states.

The course is set for the fledgling digital currency that is Bitcoin to become the dominant force people will gravitate towards. Just like armies gravitated towards gunpowder and achieved domination over those that didn’t, Bitcoin will at some point break the back of the existing fiat financial monopoly. Bitcoin is creative destruction playing out on the monetary protocol level. Bitcoin is financial gunpowder.
