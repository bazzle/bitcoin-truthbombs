# The hare and the tortoise of crypto 2

Crypto, with its catchy names, funky logos and irresistible tech talking points like transaction speeds, web3, smart contracts, dapps and dao’s, aswell as the attraction of staking yields and single day double-digit price movements create the environment where the high time preference crypto moonboy – – likes to inhabit.

They might be able to capitalise at the right time in the bull market depending on the particular shitcoin they are holding, but will more than likely eventually get rekt, like the average punter at a casino. They might win big on the roulette table, but they are unlikely to leave the building with anything but empty bags. Needless to say by the end of the bull market, when the party is over, they will be holding less than the bitcoin hodler – the tortoise in the tale.

**The bitcoiner hodler dollar cost averages through the market cycles.**And despite seeing the value of their stack swing wildly through the price volatility, do not sell large portions. Remaining unemotional, firm, steadfast and humble.

**For the crypto moonboy, the bull market is the race to riches.**For the bitcoin hodler, the bull market is a time of irrational hype. An unwelcome distraction. A time when bitcoin is no longer selling at a discount. That’s right, bitcoin hodlers celebrate the price dropping, so they can stack sats at a much lower price.

**Naturally, the bitcoin hodler, in being uninterested in winning the race to riches has won that race already.** The proven winning strategy of dollar cost averaging in an asset that appreciates over time will always beat short term speculation. The hodler, in adopting the healthier mindset of saving money in a verifiably scarce asset, rather than speculating in the latest crypto trend will reap dividends beyond monetary.

**But, to actually be the humble tortoise, to be the bitcoin hodler is a challenge in itself**. Just staying humble is a challenge in modern society, which rewards narcisism and pushes us towards everything that is meaningless, fleeting and superficial. A challenge in dedicating hours of education in bitcoin to have the conviction requred to overcome the natural tendency to sell out through fear and uncertainty. A challenge in pulling away from fiat conditioning, through conviction towards a new monetary paradigm that is bitcoin. Stay Humble, Stack Sats is more than a strategy for acquiring bitcoin, it’s step in the direction towards a healthy low time preference mindset and a vote for more equal, productive and peaceful future for society.

Bitcoin is slow, steady and largely unchanging–characteristics that are necessary for bitcoin to be a monetary protocol, a base software and settlement layer that other things are built upon, and a trusted store of monetary value, important because nobody would want to put their life savings in a technology that is changing all the time at its core.

On a regulatory level, bitcoin is regarded as a commodity, and so enjoys clarity in that regard. Through it’s[immaculate conception](https://bitcoin-truthbombs.com/immaculate-conception/), Bitcoin has become fully decentralised. Unlike most altcoins, there is no single authority on the network that issues new coins, and one bitcoin always equals one bitcoin—both differentiating factors in commodity and security classification.

On the fundamental level, Bitcoin has found its feet as a monetary protocol—a bedrock settlement layer which things are built upon. Decentralised enough to survive attempts by powerful external forces to censor, corrupt or change it in line with contemporary political virtues.

There are many more strands we can pull at when we think about how Bitcoin and altcoins inhabit these hare and tortoise archetypes. Diving into them all could fill a book. We can skip to exploring*why*altcoins are the hare and Bitcoin is the tortoise. The network proliferated and decentralised long before cryptocurrency became a thing. And with the disappearance of Satoshi, the vulnerability of a known founder being coerced by outside forces to make make protocol changes disappeared, leaving Bitcoin largely immutable and ossified.
