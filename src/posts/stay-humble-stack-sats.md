# Stay humble, stack sats

Knowing all they have to do to achieve generational wealth is to ignore the rabble coming from the crypto casino and to keep buying bitcoin on a basis as consistent and unwavering as the stride of the tortoise in the well known tale.

Crypto with its catchy names, funky logos and irresistible tech talking points like transaction speeds, web3, smart contracts, dapps dao’s, staking yields and single day double-digit price movements —create the environment where the high time preference crypto moon boy, the hare in the tale, likes to inhabit.

They might be able to capitalise at the right time depending on the particular altcoin they are holding, but will more than likely eventually get rekt, like the gambling addict at a casino. They might enjoy the high of winning big at the roulette table, but they are unlikely to leave the building with any money left. Needless to say by the end of the bull market, when the party is over, they will be holding less than the bitcoin HODL’er.

**The bitcoiner HODL’er dollar cost averages through the market cycles.**And despite seeing the value of their stack swing wildly through the price volatility, do not sell large portions. Remaining unemotional, firm, steadfast and humble.

**For the crypto moon boy, the bull market is the race to riches.**For the bitcoin hodler, the bull market is a time of irrational hype. An unwelcome distraction. A time when bitcoin is no longer selling at a discount. That’s right, bitcoin hodlers celebrate the price dropping, so they can stack sats at a much lower price.

**Naturally, the bitcoin hodler, in being uninterested in winning the race to riches has won that race already.** The proven winning strategy of dollar cost averaging in an asset that appreciates over time will always beat short term speculation. The hodler, in adopting the healthier mindset of saving money in a verifiably scarce asset, rather than speculating in the latest crypto trend will reap dividends beyond monetary.

**But, to actually be the humble tortoise, to be the bitcoin hodler is a challenge in itself**. Just staying humble is not easy in modern society, which rewards narcissism, status and pushes us towards everything that is meaningless, fleeting and superficial. A challenge in dedicating hours of education in bitcoin to have the conviction required to overcome the natural tendency to sell out through fear and uncertainty. A challenge in pulling away from fiat conditioning, through conviction towards the new monetary paradigm that is bitcoin. Stay Humble, Stack Sats is more than a strategy for acquiring bitcoin, it’s step in the direction towards a healthy low[time preference](https://bitcoin-truthbombs.com/time-preference/)mindset and a vote for more equal, productive and peaceful future for society.
