excerpt: 'When we consider how we express ourselves and how we as individuals and collectives show ourselves up to the world, we might think about art, theatrical performance, culture, the religion we ascribe to or the political virtues we align ourselves with.'

# Money as expression

But if we think of self-expression as a signal, the signal we give off to the world through these means might not transmit as clearly as we think it does. We don’t tend to think of money as a form of expression, but due to its unique traits, money is actually**the**most truthful medium by which we express ourselves. Consciously or not we express who we are every time we reach for our wallet or credit card to buy something. We express what we truly value through the expenditure of our hard earned money, because we know we’ve traded our time for that money, and our time in precious to us.

We don’t only express ourselves as individuals through our spending habits, we collectively express ourselves as active participants of an economy through the use of money. In our chaotic world where value is totally subjective, money, in simply being a medium of exchange, inadvertently becomes a mirror that reflects human activity more closely than anything else. In free market economies where a spontaneous order is established between those that supply goods and those that buy them, money is the expression that signals to the supplier when and where to increase or decrease supply or increase or decrease prices. These signals can compress everyone’s wants and needs on the demand side aswell as factors that affect things on the supply side, down into a simple number, the price we pay for something. There is no need to know all the stories that affect the price, this is all reflected or expressed in the price itself. Robert Breedlove likes to call money*data compression*.

This perfect expression of value made possible by money, and the signal transmitted by the use of money is degraded by monetary manipulation.

Author Seb Bunney talks about the corruption of money in his book “The Hidden Cost of Money” and, as discussed in his chat with Breedlove on his podcast, he finds the suppression of monetary expression, as a symptom of the corruption of money is damaging to an economy and the well-being of society as a whole, in the same way as depression in a person is often caused by a persons self-expression being forcefully or coercively suppressed in their formative years.
