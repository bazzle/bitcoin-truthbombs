# Flies are only attracted to the broken eggs

When FTX collapsed it was the second biggest crypto exchange. An exchange that went online as late as 2019, ten years after the first block was mined on the bitcoin network. How was this even possible? The answer is the perfect storm of an extremely inteligent and canny but sociopathic founder finding his feet in the unregulated wild-west crypto industry which allows these types to thrive, and seemingly unlimited funding from venture capitalists.

Crypto became the VC’s wet dream and Sam Bankman-fried was that guy who said all the things they were wanting to hear. Fast forward three years to the recent events at the time of writing, Sam announced on twitter, the ultimate death knell of crypto custodians. That they are pausing withdrawals on their platform. What is alleged to have happened between then and now is not

It is painfully apparent, that FTX and their trading arm, Alameda Research did all manner of shady things with depositors money, and curried favour with politicians and regulators alike. The story of FTX is jaw-dropping but way beyond the scope of this article. A story that takes you from casual games of League of Legends, to a spat with a fellow billionnaire exchange founder, an alleged sex tape and the Joe Biden adminstration midterm re-election campaign. The purpose of this article is to highlight how true the old Chinese proverb above rings. Venture capitalists, politicians and mainstream media are attracted to people like Sam Bankman Fried, and companies like FTX like moths to the flame, or flies to the broken egg. Crypto really is a cesspit of deception, manipulation and straight up lies masquerading as truth and morality, and this should be a cautionary tale for everyone. If there’s a fly on an egg, it is probably cracked. Don’t get swept up in the mania. Sell any shitcoins for bitcoin, get it off that exchange and into cold-storage. Remember the only truth in crypto is bitcoin.
