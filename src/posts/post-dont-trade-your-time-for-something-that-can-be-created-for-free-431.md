# Don&#8217;t trade your time for something that can be created for free

Scarcity is an attribute that anything can have, and generally speaking if that thing is scarce it is valued and sought after more. This can be said about a collectible, a person who is one of a kind, a unique experience, or being in love — because finding someone you love doesn’t happen regularly, it is strong, binding and holds a lot of value.

Lex Fridman mentioned this in his amazing podcast with Joe Pompliano. He jabbed at dating apps because they introduce abundance in opportunities for dating and so dilutes the value of dating and love.

The same might also be said if someone invented a way we can live forever, would our experiences become just as mundane and low value? Maybe the finiteness of time we have is what tells us to enjoy every experience to the fullest. Maybe time itself is above all the most scarce asset we have.

Would you want to trade places with Warren Buffett? At the time of writing he’s the sixth richest person in the world, and he’s also 93 years of age.

So why do we trade our scarce time for a money that is not scarce — fiat currency, a soft form of money who’s value is set at the whim of small groups of central bankers and often unelected decision makers.

What has scarcity got to do with Bitcoin? Bitcoin has a capped supply of 21 million coins. No more coins will ever be minted. And the decentralised network of nodes are incentivised to ensure this cap isn’t ever increased. This makes it a better store of value than the US dollar or any other fiat currency over time.

The fixed supply of 21 million, the difficulty adjustment and the declining block reward are features of this….
