# Why corporations need bitcoin

If a company holds its treasuries in fiat, they need to perpetually increase their income by a proportion greater than the inflation rate of the money they hold so they can survive long-term and continue to pay their suppliers, and if publicly listed — appease their shareholders with a consistent return. There can also be an incentive to cut costs, degrading the quality of their product. If they have competitors that are holding a better form of money like Bitcoin, they are at a distinct disadvantage.
