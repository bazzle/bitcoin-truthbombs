# Borrowing from our future

The perhaps unexpected answer is, our children. Through the hidden tax that is inflation. Just like is happening now, our children will have to work harder and harder to maintain their quality of life. As the money they are being paid in loses value in real terms, at an ever increasing rate. Future generations will be paying for the unhinged expansion of the money supply that our governments and central banks are partaking in right now.

When you zoom out and ponder monetary inflation for a moment, it is quite a simple concept really. Our money supply is increasing dramatically. Yet the supply of nearly everything you can buy with it stays much the same. In other words, an ever increasing supply of money in circulation is chasing the same amount of goods.

There are two distinct forces at play that influence the affordability of goods and services to people – the deflationary force of technology, and the inflationary force of fiat money.

Technology has always had a deflationary effect. By making goods and services cheaper, more reliable and more abundant through improvements in technology of the goods themselves and the productivity in making them available. The filament in a cheap mass-producted light bulb can reliably produce light for years on end. A candlestick before Thomas Edison’s technological breakthrough would have cost much more money to provide much less light, for a far shorter period of time.

As a result supply for goods increases, and supply and demand dynamics see that costs go down. If deflationary effects were to go unhindered, we might be living the 15 hour working week imagined by John Maynard Keynes, who predicted that technology powered productivity gains would free us from the shackles of work and live lives of leisure and personal persuits.

However we have our inflationary monetary system to keep deflation in check. By expanding the monetary supply, the affordability of goods remains constant. People are incentivised to continue working long hours to maintain their quality of life. And governments and corporations close to the issuance of money are able to finance capital intensive propositions such as wars, vanity projects and the welfare state. By borrowing money at todays prices, and paying back tomorrow when that amount of money is worth less. This is the essence of our credit based economies, and many would argue the driving force behind economic prosperity.

The balance between inflation and deflation has been kept in a carefully calibrated equilibrium for by fiat money manipulators throughout the modern era of the fiat monetary system. A 2% inflation rate is often quoted as being the target.

This all changed in recent years, the pandemic has seen the US M2 money supply gain by 40% over that period. The pendulum has swung so far one way it’s flown off the table and shattered into pieces on the cold hard floor. The balance is lost forever until a new monetary system can be found.
