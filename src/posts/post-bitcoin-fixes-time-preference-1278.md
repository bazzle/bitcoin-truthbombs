# Bitcoin fixes time preference

Knut Svanholm[link to article](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoins-absolute-scarcity-changes-your-life)

Inflationary fiat encourages high time-preference. Because you’re incentivised to spend and consume before you get robbed.

Svanholm: A high time preference is when you prioritize quick satisfaction, when you don’t delay gratification. So if you’re robbed of everything you own, you adopt a high time preference because you need to, because you need food to survive and you need shelter to not — in most places — you need shelter not to freeze to death at night. So you become a high-time-preference individual that prioritizes short-term gains which also makes you prone to crime and bad decision making, short-term decision-making.

Svanholm: Talk about how Argentina is filling restaurants.It ties into something my grandfather said, which is, “That which you can do without, you own,” which is something that has been stuck in my mind ever since the first time I heard it. It’s the flip side of “Your possessions end up owning you.” Because if you can control your mind to the extent that you don’t crave things anymore, then you own those things that you don’t crave, in a sense. For instance, I would never buy a Lambo regardless of how much bitcoin I have or how wealthy I become. I don’t crave Lambos. In a sense, I own all the Lambos because I control my urges. I think Bitcoin is like a gateway drug to that insight.

Mention something about how reduced consumption fixes the environment
