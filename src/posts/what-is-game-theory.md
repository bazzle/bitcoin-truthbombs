# Game Theory

In the past decade, thanks to the ever-increasing popularity of Bitcoin, blockchain technology has attracted a significant degree of attention from both academia and industry. Generally speaking, blockchain is identified as the technology behind Bitcoin.

However, the Bitcoin blockchain is much more than tech.

All the three main technologies that are leveraged by Bitcoin (a peer-to-peer network, asymmetric cryptography and digital timestamping) had been around for many years. They are not the reason that made Bitcoin special.
Defining Bitcoin as a mere technology would be a mistake. It is, in fact, a masterpiece of technology, economics, mathematics, game theory and, last but not least, philosophy. For the first article of this series, I want to focus on Bitcoin as a masterpiece of Game Theory.

But First… What Is Game Theory?

Game theory studies the process of strategic interactions between two or more players in a situation where the outcome for each participant depends on the action of all.

Game Theory — Osmo Rauhala

In practice, if you are a player in such a game you must take into account the choices of others when contemplating your strategy. Thinking about their choices, you should also be aware that they are thinking about yours.

Game theory is based on the assumption that all participants are rational actors and are trying to maximize their gains from the game.

The study of game theory is characterized by the following elements:

Game: Any set of circumstances that has a result dependent on the actions of two or more decision-makers (players).

- Players: A strategic decision-maker within the context of the game.
- Strategy: A complete plan of action a player will take given the set of circumstances that might arise within the game.
- Payoff: The payout a player receives from arriving at a particular outcome. The payout can be in any quantifiable form.
- Information set: The information available at a given point in the game. The term information set is most usually applied when the game has a sequential component.
- Equilibrium: The point in a game where both players have made their decisions and an outcome is reached.
- Game theory is especially applied in social situations, where there is no black or white. That is because, when interacting with each other, human beings are highly complex. Predicting one behavior might be as complex as predicting the future, as it is the result of the interaction of their strategies, payoffs and information sets.

## Let us have an example:

You are in a bar with your best friend and you see 2 girls at the bar counter. One of them is a 10 and the other one is a 6. This game has two players and two payoffs, and can have four different outcomes. The first outcome is as follows, both you and your friend go for the 10, you hinder each other and none of you get the girl. In plain words: the payoff is 0. Same goes for the second outcome, where you both go for the 6. Once again you block each other and none of manages to get the girl. Also in this outcome, the payoff is 0.

The other two outcomes are:

1\. You get the 10 and your friend gets the 6 or;
2\. Your friend gets the 10 and you get the 6.

With these two outcomes, your payoffs will be maximised and you would have reached the so-called Nash Equilibrium. That is, a situation when the strategies of all players are consistent and where each one chooses the best response to the choices of others. As a result, the players of the game should follow either one of the latter strategies.

## How Is Game Theory Applied To Bitcoin?

What Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin, did was to find the missing piece of the puzzle: how to ensure that all the actors of a decentralized network behave correctly without trusting each other, an issue that is commonly known as the Byzantine Generals problem.

### The problem of Byzantine Generals.

In simple terms, it is a problem of coordination. The Byzantines are trying to conquer a city, but the attack will only be successful if all generals coordinate and attack together.
The problem is how to ensure that all generals will follow the plan, even if they are located in different places and do not trust each other.

## How Does Bitcoin Solve The Problem?

The players in the Bitcoin blockchain are the users of the network and the miners that maintain it. Since Bitcoin is a distributed network, the miners are essential for the network to work correctly as they confirm the validity of transactions.
In simple words, Bitcoin uses game theory and a system of material incentives to make sure that rational actors behave in a certain manner by aligning their interests. In particular, they have been used to influence the interactions and the behavior of the miners of the network.

First of all, it is important to lay forward that an agreement on the correct version of the ledger within the Bitcoin network is reached using a Proof-of-Work algorithm: miners have to run computationally expensive operations to mine Bitcoins, incurring in significant electric costs. This makes computation expensive, to ensure that miners do not deviate from the rules of the network. To encourage miners to behave in an honest manner, Bitcoin provides an incentive mechanism, to make sure their self-interest is linked to the network functioning well. What Are The Incentives Provided To Miners?

The first transaction in every new block is a so-called “coinbase” transaction that mints new Bitcoins (12,5 every block), going to the creator of the block. That is, to the lucky miner that managed to find the correct block before the others.
It is comparable to a high five by the Bitcoin network: “thanks a lot for maintaining the network with your mining power, here you have 12,5 BTC as a reward!!”.

This might seem a lot but, as mentioned before, miners have to deal with high electricity, hardware and maintenance costs.

Furthermore, the chances of finding the right block before other miners are directly proportional to the % of hashing power controlled and thus — unless you are part of the biggest mining pools — is quite low.
Such material incentives in the form of monetary rewards motivate the nodes to behave uprightly and to support the network, as well as ensuring a fixed and constant emission of new coins in circulation — as there is no central bank to do so in the Bitcoin blockchain!

As an additional incentive, the miners powering up the Bitcoin network also receive a cut on the transactions included in a block. All of these incentives discourage actors from being malicious or trying to attack the Bitcoin network.
The only way an attacker can compromise or tamper the Bitcoin blockchain is by gathering at least 51% of the hashing power. Let us say that a malicious actor is trying to assemble enough power to do so.
He will first have to find expensive hardware — as all of it is currently owned by other miners. If he eventually succeeded he would then have to compromise the network, however, since he is already deeply invested in Bitcoin mining hardware he would not be incentivized to do so.

In case he managed to attack the Bitcoin network, the cryptocurrency would immediately lose significant value — as one of its premises is that its blockchain cannot tamper.
The hacker loot would then become worthless!

As a result, hackers might find it more profitable to stick to the rules rather than trying to undermine the system and their wealth.

Each actor is better off by playing by the rules. Not because they are forced to do so, but because this ensures that everyone benefits from the network.

It is, in fact, a win-win situation, and that is why I believe Bitcoin is a masterpiece of game theory.

The design of efficient economic incentives and cryptography to build blockchain systems has become known as Cryptoeconomics. Its role is to provide the framework to ensure the development of strong and balanced peer-to-peer networks and to encourage desired behaviors.

It is very much important to mention that these incentives work on Bitcoin due to the size and security of the blockchain, the protocol rules as well as the inherent characteristics of the network.

The same logic applied to smaller networks might not provide the same results in terms of encouragement or balance between the actors of the network.
Bitcoin As A Masterpiece of Game Theory

## To sum it up:

Bitcoin did not become as relevant as it is nowadays only thanks to the technologies behind it.

Rather, its value and beauty come from the fact that it encompasses several fields and subjects.

The introduction of Game Theory in the equation makes it possible for the network to function correctly and to direct the behavior of actors towards the desired outcome. By making use of a system of incentives, Bitcoin manages to align the interests of distrustful actors in a distributed network.

This creates an equilibrium between the different strategies of the actors. That is: everyone gets the biggest payouts if their strategies are coordinated. This guarantees the correct functioning of the network and the reduction of eventual vectors of attacks as well as possible incentives that actors might have to attack the network.
