# Money is a battery

Perhaps a better way to think about money as energy is to consider an everyday analogy that we understand all too well: the battery in our cell phone or tablet computer. I’m sure most of us prefer a cell phone with a long battery life for the same reason I prefer a monetary unit that has a long battery life. Something that stores energy (purchasing power) and has almost no leakage over time is much more desirable as money than something that loses its charge (value) quickly.

If I store my life energy in the Argentinian peso, its energy will deplete by 50% in one year thereby making saving for retirement “mission impossible.” Storing my life energy in the U.S. dollar is certainly preferable to storing it in the Argentinian peso. However, we are living in an age where every currency is rapidly losing its value. All fiat currencies are in a race towards zero. There has never been a period in human history where fiat currency wasn’t debased into worthlessness.
