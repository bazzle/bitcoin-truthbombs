Going from fiat to bitcoin maxi, two mindsets which are radically antithetical to eachother, is a profound journey of discovery every maxi goes on. Almost like a rite of passage for bitcoiners. Flipping on its head all of the preconceived beliefs about what money is and what it should be.

The rabbit hole, the orange pill, seeing the matrix. All these memes point to one thing. An exhilarating ride to becoming educated on both the state-weaponised fiat monetary system and its shortcomings as a money and the brave new world of bitcoin – the incentives that go with it, and the positive consequences to the individual and the society.

Every journey needs a beginning, and it’s when a pleb-to-be bites the bullet and buys some bitcoin that they start their journey, they will likely and understandably see the fiat denominated price as the signal to watch for. The idea that fiat is the yardstick of value is embedded deep in our conditioning sadly, and gives us the mental model that fiat price is everything. This is reinforced by the investment community where stocks, bonds, commodities, real-estate and other investments are generally seen as ways of maximising fiat in the long-run, by selling positions or earning yield. Investing in crypto is no different. Fiat maximisation is the sensible approach when investing in shitcoins as they tend to have limited shelf lives, the only strategy that can work is knowing when to exit with sufficient gains before the price goes to zero.

Fiat money is embedded deep in our conditioning sadly. And when something comes along that challenges the fiat monopoly, it can be difficult for people to upend their entire belief systems about what money is, and they may react with hostility. Other people may not have had any understanding on what money is at its core in the first place, and might start asking uncomfortable questions which they never thought they’d ask.

But those with open minds and a willingness to learn are likely to change their mindsets and realise the best assets are the scarcest assets. They will shift from thinking about the value of their bitcoin stack in fiat terms to bitcoin terms. For this reason they will become much less likely to be shaken out of their positions through price volatility and celebrate the price drops, as they present the opportunity to stack sats at a discount.
