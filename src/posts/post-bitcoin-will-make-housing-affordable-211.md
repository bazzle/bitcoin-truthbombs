# Bitcoin will make housing affordable

**Investing in commodities is immoral if you pause to think about it.**Pushing up prices beyond the grasp of the those who actually need that thing. Real estate is a perfect example where its supply and demand dynamics are skewed by being an investment asset. With inflation skyrocketing, so is the trend towards investors looking for places to park their money. This has resulted in disastrous consequences for towns and cities, the populations living within them and their cultural identity. People are discriminated against, in favour of faceless financial interests like property developers, pensions and various wealth funds. Priced out locals are forced to move away, severing generational ties with localities and taking with them the cultural traditions that make those places unique. Transitioning cities to bland monocultural hubs where houses, if not empty are occupied by the wealthy and location-agnostic digital nomads.

In a fair society, the price of a commodity like housing should be dictated exclusively by the supply and demand of the actual good, not by the investors who speculate on it. There must be a shift away from financialisation towards humanism. Bitcoin can accelerate that shift, by providing a non-exploitative alternative for investors. An asset that doesn’t depend on the demand of a human right to provide investment return, and maintains value through programmed scarcity, a supply cap and incentives that ensure demand over time.**An asset that does not exclude good, hard working people from their right to affordable housing.**
