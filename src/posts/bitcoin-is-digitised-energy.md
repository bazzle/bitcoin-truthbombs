Bitcoin, with its proof of work concensus mechanism ensures that every coin, at its creation has been minted through a certain amount of physical work/energy expended. This anchors bitcoin to the physical world, ensuring immutable transferrence of value from physical work into money, and prevents some people getting money for nothing. Like the cantillionnaires close to the “Magic money tree” or money printer of the fiat financial system. In other words, proof of work

Hard money is a representation of physical work and energy consumed. For a money to have high stock to flow implies work is required to create new issuance, and the amount of work required to create that in relation to the existing supply is what dictates its scarcity and value in the eyes of the people who transact with it.

Proof of work ensures the issuance of new coins are linked to the physical world, as opposed to the fiat banking system and proof of stake blockchains. The need for this link to the real-world is pretty key for a functional monetary system. Why is that?

The only thing that is truly scarce in the universe is time.
