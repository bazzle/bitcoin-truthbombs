# Social media is trash

You might think… Social media was supposed to bring in a new paradigm of self-expression. And for the most part it has. It has given everyone a voice and a platform to show themselves to the world in a very efficient and accessible way. But censorship by governments and the commercial interests of the centralised platforms that people use to broadcast their messages have disrupted and degraded the medium. Financialisation has turned the messages into a commodity and in turn made it a dishonest form of expression. With clicks, ad views and algorithm appeasement the ultimate goal. Visibility of the message has become more important than the message itself.

The ease and low-effort nature of social media has also led to its degradation as a medium of self-expression. There is almost zero effort in broadcasting content, so people express the most mundane thoughts as quickly as they think of them. And the algorithms reward quantity over quality, and sensationalism over reason. Expression online via social media is low value, throwaway and often disingenuous — not reflective of the person’s true identity and nature and low in importance and value. All things said, social media is nothing more than talk, and talk is cheap.

Money however is the purest, clearest and most truthful medium of expression, because it communicates value. In our chaotic world where value is totally subjective, money, in simply being a medium of exchange, communicates what we truly value, and though our economic system of supply and demand These signals can compress everyone’s wants, needs and virtues on a personal, collective and cultural level down into a simple number. Robert Breedlove likes to call money*data compression*.

In a way money is also truth serum. The social media influencer might promote goods that are positive for the environment on social media platforms, but not think about ever buying those products with their own money. The political party might U-turn on a particular policy after a lobby group have offered to fund their campaign. People might become cynical about a politician when they see he or she doesn’t follow through with their capital intensive proposals.

Monetary manipulation, rife in the fiat monetary construct we currently have introduces noise to the channel, disrupting the pure signal money provides.
